Ben Seefeldt's GreekKey's Translation Software
Author: Ben Seefeldt (BenSeefeldt@gmail.com)
Version: 0.5
Released: November 29, 2011

Included:
README.TXT-This file
LICENSE.TXT-Contains usage and modification requirements for the program.
translationTable-A required file to use the program, which contains the changes between GreekKeys and Unicode.
lib/-Contains libraries for the visual interface. (To be removed in future versions.)
GreekTranslator.jar-The executable file to run the program.

Currently the translation table only supports the "Athenian" GreekKeys font, with
more to come as demand requires. Use should be relatively straightforward. Old 
text goes on the lefthand side and is translated upon button press to the right
side.

Edititng the translation table can be done by pressing 'Show Table'. Ensure that
the table is saved and closed before translating again.

Please contact me with any questions.
